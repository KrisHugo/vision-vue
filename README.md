# vision

这个和之前的vision respository是一个东西，但是想改用vue来实现。
之前完全没搞明白的vue，现在勉勉强强能够实现了。
总之下面的部署步骤我就不动他了，放在最底下。
然后下面是开发日志：

## Developing Journal
Here's for noticing the important improvements about this project.
### 0. Start-up
Build a basement with the great help from vue + vite.
There is still nothing which is what I want to achieve in this project named 'vision'.
#### 0.1. Forum Layout
I've tried to make the page responsive, but it's a truly hardwork.
Another task is to build some component with soft animation.
And yes, I already get a satisfied component - queryBar/searchBar with great animate reaction while I try to focus on it.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
